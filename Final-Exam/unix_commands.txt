# part (a)
# How would you print the file classlist.csv to the screen
# except the two header lines?
# Enter the relevant Unix command(s) used below.

#!/bin/bash
filename = classlist.csv
read filename #just in case
m = 2
newfilename = classlistnew.csv

read m #i just want to make sure the program obtains the value m
head -n -"$m" "$filename" > "$newfilename"  #so this will take away the first two lines
# this will also make a new file without the two lines which i will then display

echo "$classlistnew.csv"



# part (b)
# How would you construct a pipeline using the command from part (a)
# to determine how many distinct students are in this list?
# Enter the relevant Unix command(s) used below as well as the number
# of students in the list.

#i would creat a file called lengths.txt so i may input the number of students in the the file from part a

wc - l "$classlistnew.csv" > "$lengths.txt"
#using word count i count the lines in the new file from part a that contains all the students then i put the number of students into the file lengths.txt.


# part (c)
# How would you sort the list by the second column (i.e., by
# "First Name")? Which student (provide first and last name) would be
# at the top of the list? Which student would be at the bottom of the
# list?
# Enter the relevant Unix command(s) used below as well as the names
# of the first and last students in the new list.

#so i woul need to sort with respect to the second column
cat classlistnew.csv | sort -a -k1 classlistnew.csv
#so i need to use -a so it can organize the list alphabetically
#i need -k1 because unix starts counting from 0 and we need to organixe from colomn 2 
# the result that should be produced would be adam holte and trish saeed

# part (d)
# Construct a Unix pipeline involving these functions to determine
# how many students have the same first name. Which first names are
# repeated in the class list?
# Enter the relevant name(s) and the Unix command(s) below.




# part (f) [BONUS]
# Construct a Unix pipeline that extracts the last three digits of
# the student number and the first character of the first name to make
# a four-character identifier for each student.
# Enter the relevant Unix command(s) used below.
